In this tutorial, we will show one approach to predicting whether a CT scan is of a patient who either has or will develop cancer within the next 12 months or not.
We will train a network to segment out potentially cancerous nodules and then use the characteristics of that segmentation to make predictions about the diagnosis of the scanned patient within a 12 month time frame.
